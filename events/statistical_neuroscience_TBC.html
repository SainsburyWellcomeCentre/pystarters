        <h1>Introduction to Statistical Neuroscience </h1><br>
        <h2>This course has been postponed.</h2>
        <h2>Details of rescheduled dates will be sent out soon</h2>

<!--        <p>Brasserie Seminar Room, Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, UCL.</p>-->
        <p>Delivered by Joaquin Rapela</p>
<!--        <h2><b><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-statistical-neuroscience-tickets-98373324261">Sign up here</a></b></h2>-->


        <h3> N.B. This course will take place over two days (TBC)</h3>

        <h4>This course will teach methods to determine the  statistical significance of differences of measures (e.g. spike rates, gene expression) across different groups (or different brain regions etc.), and their implementation in Python (mainly using the <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org">statsmodels</a> package)</h4>

        <h4>This course should be of interest to neuroscientists that want to acquire Python skills to compare experimental measurements across groups, and that want to learn the basic statistics to better understand the output of the tests used to perform these comparisons.</h4>
            <h4>It could also be of interest to scientists that know how to test for group differences but want to learn how to implement these tests in Python.</h4>


        <h2>Outline</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>How to perform in Python statistical tests of difference in measures from multiple groups, and how to interpret the outcome of these tests</li>
            <li>Basic statistics about how the tests function and what outputs they provide</li>
            <li>How to visualize your data and its statistics, in matplotlib and in plotly</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Syllabus</h2>


        <ul>

            <li> t-test for comparing means of two groups. e.g., is the path efficiency of experience mice larger that that of naive mice? </li>

            <li> ANOVA for comparing means of more than two groups. e.g., is the firing rate of cells significantly different across brain regions (e.g., V1, superior culliculus, retrosplenial cortex, retina), layers (e.g., layer 2 and 3, layer 4, layer 6) and cell types (e.g., inhibitory and excitatory)?</li>

            <li> Regression for assessing relations between continuous variables. e.g., is there a linear relation between the firing rate of a visual cell and the intensity of pixels of the images used to stimulate this cell (i.e., linear receptive field estimation)?</li>

            <li> Regression with dummy variables (i.e., ANCOVA) to assess the relation between a continuous variable (e.g., LFP) and both categorical variables (e.g., wild or mutant mouse) and continuous variables (e.g., stimulus intensity). </li>

        </ul>
